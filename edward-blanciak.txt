Stretch Questions

    2. What happens when an element is positioned absolutely? 
      The element is removed from the normal document flow, and no space is created for the element in the page layout.

    3. How do I make an element take up only the amount of space it needs but also have the ability to give it a width?
      flexbox layout 
    4. Name 3 elements that are diplay block by default, 2 elements that are display inline by default and 1 element that is display inline-block by default
    display block - div, p, section
    display inline - span, a
    display inline-block - nav

    5. In your own words, explain the box model. What is the fix for the box model? 

    |margin -very outside / level 4
    |  |border  - outside / level 3
    |  |  |padding - inside / level 2
    |  |  |  |content - very inside / level 1

    The box model is a set of rules deciding the size of elements. The box model is a set of 4 rectangles inside of each other. Margin is the very outside of the box. In from there is the border. Inside of the border is the padding. Lastly, on the very inside of the box model is the content. The solution to the box model is box-sizing: border-box.
